# auto-commit-msg

A small command-line utility to generate commit messages by passing the git diff to an LLM. No more `"wip"`, `"stuff`, or `"sdmcskdc"` cluttering the commit log.

Status: Work in Progress


Todo:

- [ ] Bug fix: don't include commit body if not generated
- [ ] Proper bundling/distribution system
- [ ] Add more LLM providers / model options
- [ ] Proper documentation
- [ ] customizable system prompt
